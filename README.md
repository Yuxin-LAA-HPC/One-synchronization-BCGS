This code is for comparing different low-synchronization variants of reorthogonalized block
classical Gram--Schmidt (BCGS) algorithms on distributed memory systems, according
to our paper:

    A stable one-synchronization variant of reorthogonalized block classical Gram--Schmidt.
    Erin Carson and Yuxin Ma. (2024) arXiv:2411.07077

The following variants have been implementated in this code:

* BCGSI+ (function bcgsi2): Also known as BCGS2, the classical reorthogonalized BCGS algorithm.

* BCGS-PIPI+ (function bcgspipi2): A two-synchronization variant proposed by [1].

* BCGSI+P-1S (function bcgsi2P1s): Our new one-synchronization variant.

* BCGSI+P-2S (function bcgsi2P2s): Our new two-synchronization variant.

* BCGSI+A-1S (function bcgsi21s): A one-synchronization variant proposed by [2].

## Remarks for running this code

### Envionment

This code requires packages including

* OPENBLAS, LAPACK, and SCALAPACK.

* Trilinos (or the sub-package Tpetra in Trilinos).
The link of Trilinos: https://trilinos.github.io

We give an example of make.inc called make.inc.example.
The users could accordingly modify the links of these related packages to compile this code.

### Structure of the code

* SRC/:

+ util.c: Includes functions to test the accuracy and to print matrices.

+ orth.c: Includes all different variants of reorthogonalized BCGS.


* TESTS/:

+ test_orth.c: Compare the performance of different variants of reorthogonalized BCGS and also check the accuracy.
